# aisd-portal-toolbox
A python script using selenium for logging into the AustinISD student portal and opening canvas &amp; google drive automatically

This is a completed modification of iHildy's aisd-portal-toolbox. They hadn't started work on it so I wanted to give it a crack to give them some motivation to start work on theirs. Hope you guys enjoy. Please check out iHildy's progress on their version of this project if they so decide to continue it.
